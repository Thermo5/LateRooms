## Additonal
Things I would like to improve:
  * Testing is inconclusive as I have not covered React testing before.
  * The Styling could be improved especially on the filter selections.
  * Give the star rating in star icons.
  * Condense the layout so that more information is available on screen.
  * Make filter elements mobile responsive.
